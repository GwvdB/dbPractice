## **1. What is this?**

This is a not so top-secret project where I (your loyal apprentice) will occasionally try to follow your instructions and code things (I guess)… and you, oh wise one, will occasionally facepalm 😅. It’s basically an exercise in "How long until you give up on teaching me?"

## **2. Why are you here?**

Because you're awesome and have the patience of a saint 🧘 (with me anyway. You sir certainly can be impatient). Also, I might definitely break things. Like… a lot. So you're probably here to save the day. Again. Because you already definitely have on a couple occasions!

## **3. My Amazing (and definitely hilariously terrible) ~~Meltdowns~~ Progress**

- **Day 1:** Successfully configured the laptop. Victory dance! 💃🎉
- **Day 2:** Typed something that might be code. Might also be gibberish. Who can tell?
- **Day 3:** Tried to run it. The computer laughed at me.
- **Day 4:** Had a heart attack when the laptop wasn't charging... Seriously I thought I broke your laptop...
- **Day 5:** Tried running MySQL with my tables. Stared stubbornly at the screen for 4 hours straight. 
- **Day 6:** Realized I forgot to write the command properly. You told me to watch out for that. Now I hear your voice in my head.
- **Day 7:** Accidentally deleted half the project... send help. 😬 - joke I haven't done this....yet. Gotta watch out with that rm command!

## **4. Motivational Quotes**

- "With great power comes great responsibility." – But let’s be honest, I’m just hoping not to break your laptop at this point... again.
- "Coding is 10% writing code and 90% Googling how to fix what you just broke." - Or what I broke cause let's face it... I'm good at breaking everything!
- "Behind every great coder is a teacher who didn’t facepalm too hard." - I'm going for mediocre at this point. I'm so used to dancing before I can even crawl.
- "Every time you fix a bug, an angel gets its wings... and another bug is born." - 👼
- "Teach a person to code, and they’ll curse your name for weeks, but they’ll thank you for a lifetime." - Admittedly, I'm not cursing you just yet......... I'm not lieing, I swear!

## **5. How to Contribute**

- **Step 1:** Fork this repo.
- **Step 2:** Brace yourself.
- **Step 3:** Fix all my bugs (this might take a while…).
- **Step 4:** Enjoy a muffin 🧁. You've earned it. (I shall make you some. Just tell me what flavour.)
- **Step 5:** I'll treat you to whatever you want.

## **6. Disclaimer**

This project comes with no guarantees:

- No guarantee that the code will run.
- No guarantee that it won't break your computer (sorry in advance).
- But it will contain hilarious errors and plenty of "WTF" moments.

[^1] Fun fact... I broke this too. For some reason my pull request isn't working 😭
